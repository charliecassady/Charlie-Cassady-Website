<!--Hello, maker! Welcome to my Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it – for this might be a real intersection on your way to becoming. Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll make a really cool web documemt that not only introduces you to the other people in our classes, but will help you process how different discourse communities in your life have contributed to your arrival in this space, virtual and actual, and also contribute to where you might be going.

In this doc, you will work through Gregory Ulmer's discourses of career, family, entertainment, community, and schooling (_Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy_, 2002.) In Ulmer's text, he elides community and schooling into one category, but for our puposes I have separated them. Ulmer's theory of electracy helps makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. Ulmer uses analogy to define electracy, explaining that "electracy is to digital media what literacy is to print."

You could make this document the easy way by posting on Google Site, an Adobe Spark, a Weebly, or a Wix, or you can do a little more work to unconceal, opening up these tools that you use every day, but might not know how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to understand what our digital tools do, how they work, and consider the implications of their use. Through this process you will also learn a little bit about computer literacy and computer science...enough to allow you to build web texts and understand file management.

So let's cut this thing open – using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would call it – lets "cut" and arrange, tweak, take away and augment...that's how we create! I hope you're excited to use this tool to create a document that will simultaneously help you process your journey and help orient you along the path on which you are headed in your becoming. Before we get going I would like to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who helped me develop the original Ulmerian framework we will be following in this document. Are you ready to get started?-->

 <!--To get started, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file (or clone it, if you know what that means). Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images, pdfs, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "atom.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the index.html and style.css files in the text editor and we can get started building our own electrate experience.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML text fields be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--First we will need to do some work in the head of the document. The head organizes important information needed to expalin to browsers how the website will work. Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document below, from "Electrate Fuego" to whatever you want it to be called. Your new text will appear in your browser tab-->
<title>Charlie Cassady's Website</title>
<!--this next section of code does important work to help different browsers understand what this page should look like on the different kinds of screens.-->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS file. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating to font, text size, image size, among other details.-->

<!--The <body> of the document houses the content that a user usually sees on a website. We'll be spending most of our time in this section.-->
<body>

<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we'll need to make some changes on your style.css file. Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block," but we will refer to it as a "Wide Image."  Think carefully about the image you select and how it might serve a sybolic function in your life. Ulmer refers to these kinds of symbolic images as "wide images" in that they often repeat over and over in our lifetime. We will similarly repeat this image at the end of your Electrate Infuego composition to establish a motif in this web document.-->

<!--The hero image is controlled on the style.css page. To replace this image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it hero.jpg. Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, and change the file type from .jpg to .png. Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png imgaes. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

<!--In our first exploration of discourse, we're going to think about the wider characteristics or themes of our field or future career. In academia, we do a lot of work narrowing our interest to arrive at a career or profession, often reducing our field to a level of operation or an act. Instead, I would like you to think more broadly about the "wider themes" you associate with your field or future career and its larger significance in improving our world. Yes...improving the world. Thinking back, where do you see exposure to those same "wider themes" in your own life? Those ah-ha moments, lessons, examples, tools, passions, or qualities that suggested this career path to you?

  <h2>Introduction and Bio</h2>

  <p>I am Charlie Cassady and I am from Chicago, Illinois. Chicago is one of my favorite places and I am so grateful to call it home. My favorite thing about Chicago is Lake Michigan. I like to spend my time at the beach as much as I can, even in the cold winters. I enjoy running and walking, so doing that along the lake is ideal. If I am not staying active by lacrosse or walking/running, I also enjoy making photo albums. I have made a few photo albums so far with pictures that have captured some of my favorite memories. I love doing this so I can look back at them and relive moments, and also see aspects of growth in my life. When it comes to education, I am studying Psychology with focus on neuroscience and the premedicine track. Psychology and neuroscience have interested me for as long as I can remember and have surrounded my life is multiple different aspects. I hope to contribute to the world in a way I can use this interest.   </p>

<!--Show us. Find those beautiful, meaningful "family" photos and pictures of your place (only you can define family). If you are concerned about issues of privacy, you can always use stock images, or get creative. Add these photos to your project folder, making sure the files end in .jpg or .png and replace the names in the grid code below. You can add more images if you wish, or subtract...you might also need to move content around to achieve balance. See what happens – sometimes you have to be playful to find the purpose of things. Since these images are smaller, you will want to resize your images to less than 600px in width. This will improve load time and thus general accesibility. Don't forget to add alt="text"-->

<!--A photo grid uses rows and column classes to create some divisions on the page that will scale with mobile devices. The style.css page provides other attributes that will adjust the image depending on the size of screens.

  <p>The Apple Vision Pro, a mixed reality headset, recently became available for purchase and is Apple's top product currently since the Apple Watch came out in 2012. This spatial computing device is beneficial to education, medical advances, and the workforce. I am admiring and honoring it for its multitude of features that no other device has carried out before. It has improved education through immersive learning, revolutionized healthcare, and provided memorable exhibits/trade shows for careers. It has made - so far- a positive impact on the community, and will continue to do so, especially as it advances in technology even more than it already has. 
Spatial computing is a combination of human interaction and computer features. It is significantly unique to a regular computer. Regarding education purposes, the Apple Vision pro offers immersive learning from spatial computing. Immersive learning allows a student to engage with material in a realistic way through the headset. It has offered an entirely new world of learning that is positively impactful. According to FXMedia Team, the immersive learning feature “...promotes deeper understanding and retention of complex concepts” due to its hands-on experience. Not only does it promote a deeper understanding of concepts, but it also is completely customizable and accommodating to each student's ability to learn. Having the ability to personalize your education experience will “foster a supportive learning environment where every student has the opportunity to thrive academically” (FXMedia Team). From personal experience, being a student, I find it much easier to grasp concepts when I have extra, customized help besides me. Having a device like the Apple Vision Pro would significantly help me because of these personalized features. Without it, and without immersive learning, I occasionally feel stuck in my notebook and textbooks. A different educational experience that is not an usual classroom experience will impact improvement of higher education for students. The way the headset is engaging with material, and not a simple textbook, can open students' minds and help them learn in a more enhancing and exciting way that can aid in retention. And, since every student learns differently, the Apple Vision pros “...advanced sensors, [educators] can receive feedback on a student’s engagement and comprehension levels in real time” (IXRlabs). This is revolutionary for students because it is now accessible, and a new integrative learning experience. 

 
The Apple Vision Pro has also transformed the training for medical professionals, as well as healthcare in general. According to the Healthcare Technology Report, “this technology enables new applications in clinical education, surgical planning, medical imaging, and behavioral health, which were previously unachievable.” Healthcare workers have made apps that work with the medical field to advance medicine. Apple's Newsroom says doctors can visualize, plan, and review surgeries in advance through an app. Doctors and surgeons can access graphs, diagrams, surgical details, and more, right in front of their eyes. The Apple Vision Pro offers so much to work with, and so much to learn for medical professionals. This is better than the usual technology because it is very integrative and realistic. Doctors can even “work” with new medical equipment through the Apple Vision Pro, which will benefit them, their medical performance, and hopefully the patients. They can go inside the heart, brain, lungs, etc. to analyze just through one app. They can analyze various conditions and literally visualize what is being affected. The medical world has remarkably grown technologically throughout time, and the Apple Vision Pro is a recent huge improvement. With all to offer, there is hope for even more advancements in medicine. It should, therefore, be used in as many hospitals and medical schools as possible.  


Yes, this advanced headset is helpful in education and for medical purposes, but it is also useful for the workplace. Having an at home office through the headset, where you can make screens as big as you want, making it easier to visualize the work. Or, having immersive meetings through the headset, collaborating, and bouncing ideas off each other in a virtual way, “ …in ways that traditional screens cannot” (FlexOS). With strong features, Antoine Bisson claims that it can “help improve efficiency and ensure workers have easy access to critical information and the ability to collaborate, all the while getting the job done.” Being productive and efficient is important in any work force. Within business and sales, the Apple Vision Pro can make a show more appealing to its audience. For example, my dad worked with the headset to make a design come to life. The goal of this is to make the exhibit or trade show experience affecting and memorable. It is helping that specific product or industry sell because the features are so unique and new. Someone would remember an integrative sale through mixed and virtual reality, rather than one person speaking at them. 
  

I find that this piece of technology is so powerful that it would be silly to not utilize it. There are many ways it can positively grow someone's mind.  



My audience is my grade school and high school, my uncle, and my dad. I am aiming this at my grade school and high school because I think that the Vision Pro should be integrated into lower-level education for kids because it is so engaging. I know neither of them have used them before, but it would be beneficial to the students. Next, I am addressing my uncle, a cardiologist, because I wonder how much the Vision Pro is used in his life. I want him to see all the features it has compared to computers. He could influence other doctors and medical students to use it. Lastly, this is for my dad because he has only seen the headset a few times for tradeshows, but since it is so appealing and integrative, it could be used for more benefits.  </p>

<!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird, but Ulmer argues that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person, how you language yourself, and even how you move through the world and interact with others. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You have the opportunity to add video content or other significant media content. You might also add images to this section (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) perhaps adding a photo grid like the one you did for the "Family" section. Experiment. You can't break this thing, right? Control Z. Control Z. Control Z... -->

<!--Add a quick caption or description of your video. You always want to make sure that you're giving your visitor context.-->
    <p> I have grown a love for cooking throughout my life because of my mom. My mom is a very talented chef and has taught me so much. Now, I constantly think of new recipes and food I can make. I love to think creativley about what I can create, or how to make something better or more nutritious. I get so excited thinking about all the possible recipes and cannot wait to execute them.    </p>


<!--Time to process. How do you use media? What role do certain kinds of media play in your life? How does media serve a social function? In what way might you be "recreating" or "remaking" media in your everyday life?

FUN FACT: "Lorem ipsum", "Lorem ipsum" was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum," developers made it non-sensical. So while you will probably never write as well as Cicero, you can always improve upon "Lorem ipsum." -->

<!--Between these divisions, you may want to add a new div element like an image (see the bottom of this html page for instructions) It's always worth thinking about how a user navigates your site. How do you want to break up the experience of scrolling down here? How might it feel on a laptop, phone, or tablet?-->

<!--We will use this next section to process your community(-ies)-->

<div class="textblock">
  <h2>Music</h2>

<!--So what exactly is your community: is it actual? virtual? Where do find your ground, or at least, where do you drop anchor, you drifter, you? While we often think of communities as neighborhoods and clubs and a group of colleagues or friends, you might find community across the frontiers of the dead, and perhaps even with those who have never lived. I'll let you explain. -->
 Music is very important to me and something I could talk about forever. I will try to go to as many concerts and music festivals as I can when they are available. My parents have definitely shaped my music greatly. Both my mom and dad see music as a part of their lives too. I do tend to listen to older music, because of them, but I also listen to recently popular artists. I love many different genres and will listen to music I have never heard before, because I know there is a high chance I will end up liking it! I am always listening to something during the majority of the day. Some of my favorite and most played artists are Smashing Pumpkins, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Mazzy Star, Pearl Jam, Caamp, America, etc. The list could go on and on. I have so much to say and so many feelings about music.
